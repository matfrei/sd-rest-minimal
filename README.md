# sd-rest-minimal
Tiny server script demonstrating how to expose Stable Diffusion through REST using flask and diffusers

## How to install
After cloning the repository and moving to the right directory, type
```
pip install -f requirements.txt
```
to install the dependencies.

## Run 

Run the server simply as 
```
python3 server.py
```
and the client in the same way:
```
python3 client.py
```
That's it, really minimal.
